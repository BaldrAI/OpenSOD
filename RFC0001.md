# RFC 0001

This document defines the Open Standard OTDR Data (or OpenSOD for short). Any compatibility or lack thereof with other formats is circumstantial. 

To properly understand this document, some rudimentary knowledge of Optical Time Delay Reflectometry is recommended.

All data the OpenSOD format uses Little-Endian byte order.

# File Structure

An OpenSOD file consists of sequential data blocks, with a Map block at the start that indexes all other blocks. Blocks are stored contiguously with no padding between them. The Map block entries appear in the same order as the blocks they reference, allowing direct calculation of block positions within the file.

## Block Organization


|  Block Name            | Required                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  Map                   | Required (MUST BE FIRST)                             |
|  General Parameters    | Required                                             |
|  Supplier Parameters   | Required                                             |
|  Fixed Parameters      | Required                                             |
|  Key Events            | Required*                                            |
|  Data Points           | Required*                                            |
|  Location  Parameters  | Optional                                             |
|  Proprietary Data      | Optional                                             |
|  OpenSOD Footer        | Required if using Location Parameters (MUST BE LAST) |


*At least one of Key Events or Data Points must be present. Modern implementations should include both.


# Implementation Guidelines

## Event Management Workflow

OTDR devices process measurement data to identify events using the following workflow:

1. Initial Detection:
   - Device analyzes trace data using thresholds defined in Fixed Parameters
   - Reflection Threshold (ReT) identifies reflective events
   - End of Transmission Threshold (EoT) identifies start/end events

2. User Modification:
   - Users can review and modify automatically detected events
   - Common modifications include:
     - Deleting false positives
     - Correcting event parameters
     - Adding missed events manually

3. Event Numbering:
   - Events should be numbered sequentially
   - Numbers should be preserved during edits when possible
   - New events should use the next available number
   - Deleted event numbers should not be reused within the same file

## File Extensions

While implementers are welcome to use (and support) any file extension they see fit, it is suggested that the`.SOD` extension is used.

## Best Practices

1. Block Generation
   - Always include both Key Events and Data Points blocks
   - Maintain sequential event numbering
   - Preserve event numbers during edits

2. Version Handling
   - Validate version compatibility
   - Handle unknown blocks gracefully

3. Location Parameters
   - Use the WGS84 coordinate system
   - Link events to locations when possible

4. Data Points
   - Use appropriate scaling factors
   - Validate trace consistency
   - Handle multiple traces carefully

## Common Pitfalls

1. Block Order
   - Map must be first
   - Footer must be last (when present)
   - Follow Map block order exactly

2. Version Numbers
   - Validate version support at a per block level
   - Later versions of blocks maynot be backwards compatible

## Map

`BlkName = "MAP"` 

```
                     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

|BlkName|Ver|Length |Num|                                       /
|---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/---|
/                          Map Data                             /
/                                                               |
|-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|
```

The Map header is similar in function and structure to a File Address Table (FAT) in the FAT32 filesystem. It provides the data needed to identify the location and size of each block within the file.

The `BLKName` field is a `string` that contains the word “`MAP`”. 

The `Ver` field is a `uint16` containing the version number of the file format - Files compatible with SR-4731 (Issue 2) typically use `2` here. OpenSOD files can use `1000` + the RFC number (e.g. for **OpenSOD RFC 0001**, the `Ver` would be `1001`). Files using OpenSOD versioning might not function with software and systems that don’t explicitly support OpenSOD.

The `Length` field is a `uint32` that indicates the end of the Header.

The `Num` field is a `uint16` that indicates the number of blocks defined in the `Map Data`

### Map Data

The `Map Data` section is a `list<MapData>` of `Num` items long.

The `MapData` structure is as follows:

```
           N N N N N N
           + + + + + +
|0-/---/-N|1 2|3 4 5 6|
|--/---/--|-+-|-+-+-+-|
|Name     |Ver|Length |
|-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|
```

The `Name` is a `string` indicating the name of the block, expected values are provided in each block definition that follows.

The `Ver` field is a `uint16` containing the block’s version number, suggested values are provided in each block definition that follows.

The `Length` field is a `uint32` that indicates the size of the block.

The `BC` field is a `char[2]` that contains the Built Condition. We believe the common codes used here are:

`BC`: as-built / Build Condition,
`CC`: as-current / Current Condition / Pre-Work,
`RC`: as-repaired / Repaired Condition / Post-Work,

`mi`: Miles

The `WaL` field is an `uint16`, which is the calibrated wavelength (in **nm**) used by the module for the test. This is supposed to be represented as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^1. This means this should be roughly 10x the wavelength detailed in the **General Parameters**.

The `AcOffs` field is an `int32` that defines the Acquisition Offset in nanoseconds as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^4 .  I.E., how much of the data was ignored due to launch blindness (the period of time during which the detector is blind after the pulse is sent/launched).

It records the Index of Refraction of the fibre under test (either detected or user-configured) as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^5. To convert this back to its decimal format, use the following formula `float ior_f = ior_i / 100000.0`. If it’s unset, then a safe default IoR is around 1.46800 (the nominal IoR of G.652 @ 1550nm).

The `BsC` field is a `uint16`, which is either detected or user-configured. It records the Backscattering Coefficient of the fibre under test.

The `AvT` field is a `uint16` that stores the sample time used to calculate averages.

The `AcRange` field is a `uint32` that stores the acquisition range in **μs** as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^4. To convert this back to its decimal format, use the following formula `float acrange_f = acrange_i / 10000.0`.

The `AcRangD` field is a `uint32` that stores the acquisition range as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^1, scaled into the metric specified by the `Unt` field. This is done using the formula `float acrangd_f = acrange_f * (C / ior_f)`.

The `FntPnlO` field is an `int32` that stores the Front Panel Offset used by some implementations.

The `ReT` field is a `uint16` that stores the Reflection Threshold (in dB as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^3) used to identify coupling/fracture/reflective events to be stored in the Key Events block.

The `EoT` field is a `uint16` that stores the End of Transmission Threshold (in dB as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^3), which is used to identify the Launch and End of the Fibre events that will be stored in the Key Events block.

The `TrT` field is a `char[2]` that defines the type of trace. The codes used are:

`ST`: Standard/Forward Trace
`RT`: Reverse Trace

The `Long` field is an `int32` defining the GPS Longitude as a fixed-point decimal with the exponent 10^7.

The `IdeLeLo` field is a `uint32` that contains the Theoretical/Ideal Lead-in Loss (in dB) from the start of the fibre to the location as a fixed-point decimal with an exponent of 10^3.

The `CableIn` field is a `string` set by the user. It is used to indicate the outer sheath code of the fibre entering the location.

The `FibreIn` field is a `string` set by the user. It is used to indicate the inner sheath code (or colour) of the fibre (e.g. Yellow) entering the location.

The `CableOut` field is a `string` set by the user. It is used to indicate the outer sheath code of the fibre exiting the location.

The `FibreOut` field is a `string` set by the user. It is used to indicate the inner sheath code (or colour) of the fibre (e.g. Blue) exiting the location.

The `Comment` field is a `string`set by the user.
